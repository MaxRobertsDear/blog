### Falling out of love with my career
By social norms, I had done everything ‘right’. Yet, despite having ‘made it’, I found my career prospects lacklustre and unfulfilling.

It was whilst watching an interview with [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMotykw0SIk), founder and CEO of Social Capital, that I realised that I had spent my whole academic career checking boxes:

☑︎ good grades from college

☑︎ take a gap year to “find myself”

☑︎ gain a master’s degree from a prestigious University

☑︎ land a graduate scheme with a Fortune 500 company

Attracted by the promise of influencing London’s skyline and working on cutting-edge technologies, I entered the world of architecture. I had grown passionate about using the skills that I had acquired through my engineering degree to effect positive change. The construction industry offered a significant opportunity to do so — the running of buildings account for ⅓ of global carbon dioxide emissions (see the [UN’s Global Status Report](https://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/UNEP%20188_GABC_en%20%28web%29.pdf%29)).

Although I got to work on interesting technical problems and collaborate with multi-disciplinary teams, I became disillusioned with the design process.

Whilst clients (in this instance, the Property Developers) are initially enthusiastic at trying new and exciting energy-saving technologies at the conceptual design stages of a project, their enthusiasm will often fade when confronted with the capital cost of implementing unconventional technologies. The few projects that were delivered according to our spec, tended to be buildings into which the clients would be moving themselves. By moving into an energy efficient building, the higher capital costs for greener technologies are offset by the long-term cost savings of running the building.

In many cases, aspects of our design would be altered beyond recognition or “value engineered” with the client, followed by further value engineering efforts by the Building Contractors (the engineers who would carry out the installation on-site). The result being a building with a significantly higher carbon footprint, in the pursuit of making a profit. When the finished product is so far removed from your design, you start to question the value that you are adding.

*January 2018, I found myself researching the software engineering industry. It seemed like the perfect fit.*

### Why I am transitioning to software development
You’re only limited by your imagination. I love the idea that you can build whatever you’re able to think of. Software engineers have the unique ability to take any idea to fruition where the cost is overwhelmingly one’s time. Once you have a laptop and Internet access, the possibilities are almost boundless. In mechanical engineering, besides one’s talent to even operate in the space, you need a lot of capital to get a working prototype let alone taking it all the way to production.

There is plenty of scope for a **highly varied career**, from developing apps that disrupt the banking sector (e.g. Monzo or Starling) to improving the patient experience in healthcare. Babylon, for example, has been able to revolutionize the healthcare industry by reducing the first-contact time for a general practitioner from 1 week to 1 hour through the innovative use of video calling technology. I’m extremely excited about this shift towards the 21st century in a technical capacity as well as the far reaching societal improvements from such a simple mobile app.

**The people are great**. For me, working with the right people was just as important as finding the right role. I got chatting to software developers at various stages of their careers by simply attending a few meetups. Some who had only just been hired following the completion of their bootcamp, others who were heading up their own companies. Speaking to fellow beginners gave me valuable insight into how they had entered the field of software engineering and hearing the sustained level of enthusiasm of those who had already accrued 10–15 years of experience reassured me that job satisfaction is high.

Numerous studies carried out by the likes of Forbes and Business Insider put Software Developers at the very top of their rankings for most rewarding careers. Their evaluation was based on work-life balance, stress levels, future job prospects, employment rates, and median salaries.

### Bootcamp vs. self-study
My initial online research suggested that self-teaching was totally achievable — all you needed was focus and commitment.

However, having spoken to software developers who were in the position of hiring, I learned that they gave preference to candidates who had been through a coding bootcamp. According to them, bootcamp graduates are typically better technical communicators, can see the bigger picture of a task, and tend to have a better understanding of how different technologies interact with one another. This makes bootcamp graduates easier to work with and means that they add value to the team early on.

The thought of putting myself through coding camp filled me with both excitement and dread, in equal measure.

Excitement, because I had hit a plateau in pace of my learning and yearned for an environment that would accelerate my progression to landing my first developer job.

Dread, because not only do most coding bootcamps in London come with a £10,000 price tag, I would be going 3 months minimum without a salary and would still have to cover the astronomical London rent as well as basic living costs. 6 months if you allow for 2 months to find yourself a job on completion of the course and then another month before you see your next paycheck.

Surely, there must be an accessible way to transition into the tech sector without selling a kidney.

### Choosing the bootcamp that’s right for you
So, you’ve decided to accelerate your learning by enrolling for a bootcamp. How do you choose which one?

Do your research!

**How is the bootcamp perceived in industry?** Understanding how highly or poorly a bootcamp is regarded by those in the position of hiring is important. If senior developers have had poor experiences with graduates of a particular bootcamp, this could serve as a red flag on your application.

**Head to your local meetups!** The tech sphere is highly social and meetups present an opportunity to engage your future peers in conversation. I wouldn’t recommend leading with “what are your opinions of XYZ?” as that can be off-putting for anyone. Take your time, get to know the people at the event and join them for drinks afterwards. The people worth talking to will almost always make their way to the nearest bar at the end of the event.

Does **the syllabus** equip you with the skills that you need for type of job that you aspire to do? Ensure that you have a good understanding of the skills required for your dream job by thoroughly researching the relevant job specs. This will not only help you identify the most suitable coding course but will also help you set goals and keep you on track to your dream job. The world of software is extraordinarily vast and is easy to lose yourself in, with the plethora of technologies to learn. Having a list of technologies specific to your preferred job role will keep you focused and motivated.

**Industry connections:** ultimately, you want a job at the end of the course. How well connected is the bootcamp to industry and would you be happy in the companies/role that the alumni ended up in? What support does the bootcamp provide for finding a job? Navigating the home page of the coding school should answer the above questions. Don’t be afraid to do a bit of detective work and look up the alumni on Linkedin. It’s reassuring to see so many bootcamp graduates end up in interesting roles and will also give insight into the steps they took to get there.

**Affordability.** A topic that too many overlook is how they’re going to pay for their course. It’s insufficient to save enough funds for the course fees and rent for the duration thereof. You also need to factor in the time it’s going to take you to find a job that you love when you complete the course. Changing careers takes courage, is stressful and emotionally challenging. You deserve to get the job that you set out for and nothing less.

Don’t let yourself fall victim to time pressure by accepting a job that you are not excited about or worse, going back to your old job because you needed the money to pay for a roof over your head. Software engineers are highly in demand, yes. However, if you have done your research, you will have noticed that most job adverts are for mid to senior level developers.

**Entering the market as a junior developer is likely going to take time. Make sure you plan accordingly.**

### Why Makers, a London based bootcamp, is the right choice for me
**The people**, first and foremost: having compared the bootcamps online, it was clear to me that the only way I would definitively discover my preference was to meet the leaders of the course in person. Whilst most bootcamps showed enthusiasm, none displayed their concern for student well-fare quite as much as Makers. My first encounter with Makers was with a member of their marketing team. As someone who had only been with the company for 6 months, I was astounded at the level of knowledge she had for the syllabus, the style of teaching, where the alumni ended up commencing their coding careers and what backgrounds they came from. Having a brand ambassador be so passionate about their work speaks volumes for the company.

**Engagement:** Alumni had reported that the careers team was not extensive enough to cope with the demand. Makers responded by expanding their team, thereby demonstrating their commitment to delivering excellent service to their students.

**300+ hiring partners:** the business development of the in-house careers support team demonstrates Makers’ appreciation for how difficult it can be for a graduate to gain a foothold in industry. By virtue of having the largest careers support team of any coding bootcamp in London, Makers shows its commitment to the success of its graduates.

**Embrace holistic health:** Addressing mental health and ensuring the well-being of students throughout the course demonstrates that at Makers, you are not just a number but a valued member of the community who deserves emotional support.

**Strongly recommended by friends in industry.** Going back to my prior point, based on conversations I’ve had with people in the tech industry and in a position of hiring, Makers has produced talented developers who have used that base of knowledge to progress in their careers.

### Rounding Up
After a lot of research, both sat behind a screen and meeting people in industry, I narrowed my decision down to full stack development. Full stack developers are deeply familiar with all the layers of the development cycle and can own any part of it, at any time. Acquiring this level of knowledge strongly appeals to me. Not only would it satisfy my curiosity for how things work but it would also enable me to work on independent projects as well as getting involved in the community by contributing to open source projects.

It’s possible to learn software engineering through self-study. However, to achieve my goals, enrolling for a 4 month bootcamp was the most appropriate choice. Being accepted onto Makers’ fellowship scheme, which has a higher bar to entry, cemented my decision. As a fellow, not only is the course fee be waived, but you are also assigned a mentor on completion of the bootcamp. The mentor guides you through your first 12 months of being a junior engineer in order to fast-track your career development to mid-level engineer. Based on my research, Makers’ fellowship programme is unrivalled in London’s market in supporting junior developers reach their full potential.

I am enormously grateful to Makers for their belief in my abilities and accepting me onto the fellowship programme. Without the fellowship programme, it would be months before I would have saved enough to cover the course fees in addition to rent. I look forward to starting the course in 2 weeks time!
