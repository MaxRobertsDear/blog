Having set up the environment, it was time to make a start on my first pull request. 

**Instructions for my first pull request:**

>> Essentially I'd like a declarative approach to writing forms, where the Fields and their Inputs can be described via JSX and errors can be supplied which are then rendered onto the Fields.

### Narrowing my Focus

I could have spent hours learning all of the technologies that were unfamiliar to me on Guildd but didn't feel that that would be the most constructive use of my time. Instead, I narrowed my focus on the technologies that I needed to manipulate in order to complete my first pull request:

* React Context
* Formik
