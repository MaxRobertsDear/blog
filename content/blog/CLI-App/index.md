Week 4 of the Makers Pre-Course is designed to equip students with a lot of the basic concepts and practices that will form the base for further development as a web developer.

One of the challenges of week 4 is to build a simple terminal based student directory.

The goal of the tutorial is to become familiar with the process of creating a project from scratch: how to do it, in what order and why to do it all.

Curious as to how I built my first interactive programme from scratch?
