### The Problem

Upon graduating from the Makers software engineering course, I noticed that some of my peers, though technically gifted, were struggling to find jobs.

Curious about their hurdles, I asked them what it was that they were interested in and what jobs they were applying to. Common answers were along the following lines:

>> I want to work on something meaningful ...

>> I want to work somewhere that uses AI and machine learning ...

>> I honestly don’t know ... I just want to get my first job in any developer job and then work out from there what I want to do long term.

None of these answers suggested that they had a well-defined career path or that they were focused in their job hunting. It seemed to me that this uncertainty about what they wanted to do was posing a significant mental barrier to job applications. 

### How and why I thought that I could help

I couldn’t help but empathise with their position. The IT sector presents a huge variety of career paths and it can be overwhelming to pick the RIGHT one. However, I felt that I could help them set effective goals to aid their job application.

**Having spent half a year researching the different career avenues by:**
1. Attending Meetups and networking with engineers of different levels of seniority from various sectors.
2. Buying a pint for friends of friends in the FinTech sector in return for sounding them out on their career using AI and ML. 
3. Asking my software developer friends exhaustively about their jobs. 

The valuable feedback gained helped form a clear career path - I knew where I wanted to be in 5 years time and how I was going to get there. 

**I was fortunate to be in contact with people to aid me in my job discovery. Not everyone on the engineering course was lucky and this is where I felt that I could help them.**

*Keen to help my peers (and I’ll be honest, earn some money to cover rent during my job hunting period), I pitched the Makers careers team on providing a job application strategy workshop. It was well received and they promptly assigned a budget to fund 2 workshop days per week. I would run 1-on-1 sessions with fellow bootcamp graduates seeking guidance in their career planning.*

### Aim 

By the end of the session, I hope to help my peers set tangible goals on how they’re going to find a clear(er) career path so that they can focus their attention on getting a job that will help them get to where they want to be. 

### Structure

The structure is very simple: 

1. Identify what they’re interested in (why did they get into coding and where would they like to see themselves in 3-5 years).
2. What kind of jobs are they applying to and do they align with what they are interested in.
3. Set SMART goals (I reached out to senior members of the tech community for input on this)
4. Follow up session 1 week later to see how they have progressed, thus making them accountable to completing their goals. 

### First day of coaching my peers in developing effective job application strategies

This evening marks the end of my first day running these strategy workshops. Though I was a little nervous that my peers might find it difficult to take advice from someone several cohorts below them (and therefore somewhat their junior), I was excited by the prospect of getting them to that “aha!” moment and seeing them narrow their focus and go on to succeed in finding a career that excited them. 

The feedback I received from my first sessions was incredibly rewarding and I hope to help as many as I can:
￼
>> Oh wow, thanks for that Max. And thanks for giving up your time doing this, it really is super helpful. It's made me re-evaluate whether I'm using my time as efficiently as I should be. Sort of had that dear in the headlights moment thinking; This dude is absolutely right.

>> Awesome, thank you man. Yeah would be good to chat to you again and discus how I got on. 👍

>> Thanks a lot Max. This is good advice. I'd definitely be up for a follow-up meeting if you would be willing to!

**I don't pretend to hold all the answers. Rather, I prompt my peers with the right questions to change their approach to job hunting and help them realise the different avenues that are available to them.**
