# Acebook Challenge

Having spent the first 8 of 12 weeks on the Makers software engineering course pairing on challenges, it was time for our first group project. Over a 2 week period, we would work in a team of 6 to build a Facebook clone.

The focus of this exercise was to develop good process:


**Testing**
* 90% or greater test coverage.
* You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
* Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.

**Good distribution of work**
* The team co-owns the code. 
* Every member of the team has made commits.
* Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request.

**Quality of work**
* Clear commit messages.
* The Linter passes on all commits.
* All pull requests are peer reviewed. 

**Documentation**
* A project description.
* How to install and run it.
* How to run tests.

### What we did
*The 2 week project was kick-started with a morning stand-up in which, among other things, the following goals were agreed upon:*

*Timetable:*

| Time          | Designation   | 
| :-----------: | :------------:| 
| 9:30          | Standup       | 
| 12:00 - 13:30 | Lunch break   |   
| 13:30         | Standup       |    
| 16:45         | Retrospective | 

* *Set up a ticketing system on github*
* *Turn project specifications into actionable user stories and add these to the ticketing system*
* *Investigate CICD tools and choose one*
* *Setup the whole project in ruby-on-rails*
* *Investigate how to run feature and unit tests in rails and what to test for in rails*
* *Investigate the file structure of a rails project*

### Let's cut to the chase

#### Challenges

1. Each team member understanding every aspect of the project.
2. Estimating how long it will take to complete a feature.
3. Sharing commits to accurately reflect everyone's contributed efforts.

#### Overcoming Challenges

1. I suggested that we frequently switch who was working on which feature to ensure that everyone fully understood every aspect of the project. We were working in 3 pairs. So, 1 person from each pair would continue working on a given feature whilst the other person moved to work on a different feature. This aided contintuity by ensuring that at least 1 person was familiar with the code that had already been written. 
2. Estimating time allocation is a skill that will be gained with experience. I overcame this challenge by being conservative and adding a 25% margin to all of our estimations.
3. Remembering to add 'Co-authored-by: ... ' in our commits 


#### Lessons learned

The most important lesson that we learned is to consider and understand the full tech stack that you intend on using. Devise, a rails helper method, proved very useful in setting up user authentication. However, it wasn't as backwards compatible as we would have liked and we would have saved 2 days of work if we had used it sooner. 

### Rounding Up

Working in a group is by far the most fun that I have had coding thus far. Not only did I enjoy applying my learnings to something tangible, I also enjoyed collaborating with a team. Given the diversity of every team member's background, it was interesting to learn different approaches to solving the same problem. 

If you're curious about our day-to-day progress, I kickstarted a Wikilog for our team and encouraged everyone to contribute:
