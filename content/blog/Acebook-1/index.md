# Acebook Challenge

Below is a record of our processes and learning throughout the 2 week Facebook clone challenge.

#### Week 1, Monday, Morning
The 2 week project was kick-started with a morning stand-up in which the following goals were decided:

Timetable:

| Time          | Designation   | 
| :-----------: | :------------:| 
| 9:30          | Standup       | 
| 12:00 - 13:30 | Lunch break   |   
| 13:30         | Standup       |    
| 16:45         | Retrospective | 

* Set up a ticketing system on github
* Turn project specifications into actionable user stories and add these to the ticketing system
* Investigate CICD tools and choose one
* Setup the whole project in ruby-on-rails
* Investigate how to run feature and unit tests in rails and what to test for in rails
* Investigate the file structure of a rails project

#### Reflections
Given that the learning goal for this two-week challenge is to learn how to use high-quality processes to build a project in a team, we decided on ruby-on-rails as our tech stack. 
  
The documentation for ruby and rails is very prescriptive, meaning less time spent on learning a new technology and allowing us more time to focus on developing high-quality project development processes. 
  
Github's inbuilt Cards option provides a convenient way of tracking/assigning project tasks. This was preferred by the team over trello as a neat way of keeping everything project-related in a single repository. 
  
Rails was a new technology for the whole team and it was therefore agreed that mobbing a practice project setup would be beneficial. This ensured that everyone is up to speed and in agreement on project file structure, thereby aiding maintainability of the project.

#### Week 1, Monday, Afternoon
Once the team felt happy with the basics of setting up a rails project, the following goals were agreed and delegated to 3 pairs:
* Investigate project management options that are available on github
* Write up meeting notes and reflect on team choices 
* Convert project specifications into user stories.

#### Reflections
The aim of the afternoon tasks was to get the project setup steps completed as far as possible, such that the team can make a start on writing the first tests and lines of functional code on Tuesday morning.
