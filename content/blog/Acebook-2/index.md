### Week 1, Tuesday, Morning, Stand up
On the morning of day 2 of our group project, it was agreed to spend the morning mobbing:
* The CI of CICD

### Reflections
Using continuous integration was prioritised before adding any functional code or tests, to ensure good development workflow (by keeping the master branch clean). 
  
The reason we chose to mob was that most of the team had not yet had the opportunity to integrate continuous integration into any past projects and this seemed to be a good opportunity for collaborative growth.

### Week 1, Tuesday, Afternoon, Stand up
With the deadline of presenting our MVP to the client (played by one of the coaches) only two days away, we thought it sensible to:
* Decide on which user stories constitute MVP
* Estimate how long it will take to complete each user story - using the following guide
* Model out the MVC
* Mock the views

### Reflections
For MVP, the team agreed that we would build a single page app that has 3 routes. The aim being to present a visual representation of the final product to the client. 
  
We also agreed that we should try to add some styling - whilst the developer might only be interested in the codebase, the clients might struggle to visualise the final product if they were presented with pages coded without any styling.

### Retrospective
We initially misused our afternoon standup session - we started mobbing a mock of the views and a model of our MVC instead of assigning and prioritising tasks. 
  
Time was wasted researching different api’s as a group, when our time would have been spent more effectively by breaking off into pairs to enact measurable project development.
