### Week 2, Tuesday, Afternoon
Achievements were shared and tasks redistributed
* added faster loading background 
* added favicon
* setup: git ignore coverage files
* setup: coverage badge added, additional configuration needed but agreed to set as low priority
* User stories updated: Post specs broken down, including new 'like' feature (Trello no longer needed)
* authentication progress: Devise now working. New users can sign up, log in, receive sign up confirmation & appropriate error messages.

### Reflections
We noted any new issues discovered and identified needed to be done next:
* add username field. (stretch goal, add username to posts)
* transfer style sheets
* delete superfluos pages
* hide forgotten password page (extra: style and incorporate it)

### Retrospective
The coverage badge was successfully added, though the team working on it realised additional configuration would be needed. We all agreed to set this as low priority, as the coverage tool itself operates fine. Learnings were made in terms of unstaging git files to be ignored. Lots of progress was made towards MVP. Username field was successfully added. Username is now visible on sign in. Feature tests where updated to match new pathing.
